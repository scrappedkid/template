# Zep

[Zep](https://docs.getzep.com/) - A long-term memory store for LLM applications.

`Zep` stores, summarizes, embeds, indexes, and enriches conversational AI chat histories, and exposes them via simple, low-latency APIs.

- Long-term memory persistence, with access to historical messages irrespective of your summarization strategy.
- Auto-summarization of memory messages based on a configurable message window. A series of summaries are stored, providing flexibility for future summarization strategies.
- Vector search over memories, with messages automatically embedded on creation.
- Auto-token counting of memories and summaries, allowing finer-grained control over prompt assembly.
- Python and JavaScript SDKs.
