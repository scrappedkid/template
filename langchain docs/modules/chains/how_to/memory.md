# Adding memory (state)

Chains can be initialized with a Memory object, which will persist data across calls to the chain. This makes a Chain stateful.

## Get started[​](#get-started "Direct link to Get started")

```python
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain  
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory  
  
conversation = ConversationChain(  
 llm=chat,  
 memory=ConversationBufferMemory()  
)  
  
conversation.run("Answer briefly. What are the first 3 colors of a rainbow?")  
# -> The first three colors of a rainbow are red, orange, and yellow.  
conversation.run("And the next 4?")  
# -> The next four colors of a rainbow are green, blue, indigo, and violet.  

```

```text
 'The next four colors of a rainbow are green, blue, indigo, and violet.'  

```

Essentially, `BaseMemory` defines an interface of how `langchain` stores memory. It allows reading of stored data through `load_memory_variables` method and storing new data through `save_context` method. You can learn more about it in the [Memory](/docs/modules/memory/) section.
